# Solutions to problems from the book: Cracking the Coding Interview
#### *No problems are posted, just solutions. If you want the problems, buy the book.

## Directions

 - Run the program in Main.
 - Type a problem number you would like to see the solution for. (example: for problem 3 from chapter 1, you would type: 1.3)

## Project Structure
 - For each problem, a class was created.
 - Each problem's class has a runProblem method.
 - Once the problem has been selected by user, an object is created and this method is called to solve the problem.
 - The code is mostly self-evident, so I have refrained from commenting thoroughly.
 - All solutions worked out as an exercise to prepare for whiteboard style interviews.
 - Documentation, general problem-solving searches, and searches on syntax were used, but never to find and copy code.
